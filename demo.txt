________

Root user : Unrestricted access on AWS account : EMAIL 
IAM User : We can limit user accesses based on his job role/work.

root : email : Unrestricted access (Changing support plan, CHanging payment/billing info / closing account)

root :..???

Least Privulages Mechanism : Provide the permissions to perform the given activities.

TL : AdministratorAccess : 
S3 : S3Admin/storageadmin : 
ec2 : ec2admin/computeadmin : 

Policy : Document that contains set of permissions on AWS env.
--> AWS Managed - JOb Function
--> AWS managed policy
--> Customer managed policy



IAM : Identity and Access management : 
S3 : Simple Storage Service : bucket : 
EC2 : Elastic compute cloud : server/box/instance/azurevm/engine : 
VPC : virtual private cloud : Network configuration
RDS : Relational Database service : 
Route53 : hosting solution : 

IAM : 

IAM user with "Administrator Access" ==> root user - account management things..

Implicit allow : We can access the resources based on the allocated policy only. If you are trying to access another services, it wont allow. 

Explicit Deny : If you deny a service once, If you allow 100 times also, deny will take effect. 

Requirement : IAM user need AdministratorAccess, But i dont want to allow access on "S3 Service".

IAM User with Administartor access = root user without account management permissions

Policy : Document that contains set of permissions on AWS env.
--> AWS Managed JOb Function
--> AWS managed policy
--> Customer managed policy

We cannot delete AWS managed polocies. 

==> Deny will always have highest priority. 
YOu allow a service 100 times, but denied 1 time = DENY


Credential report : Gives report on all IAM user and their pwd last used and pwd age.

arn : Amazon Resource Name : arn:aws:iam::501170964283:user/AdminUser

--> Policy Simulator
--> Permissions boundary
--> Inline policy
--> Roles / Identity provider : Later


Requirement ; i need an IAM user with Administrator access, but not on s3 service. 

Task 1 : create an IAM user, provide him "S3 Full Access".. Allow him to Activate and deactive MFA himself. Create a Policy and associate it, test it.


Task 2 : Create an IAM user, provide "AdministratorAccess".. Try to access "Billing information". (it wont allow). 
--> how can you allow billing access.

Task 3 : create an IAM user, provide "AdministratorAccess", but Deny S3.
